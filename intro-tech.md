# Technical Introduction

Before going entering into the technical details of the RGB, an introduction over the fundamental elements of the protocol, the environment undepinning the technological substrate, as well as the base terminology represent an essentia step towards a thorough understanding of the subject.

# Paradigm of Distributed Computing

* RGB locate itself as an additional piece of the ample word of *Distributed Computing*.
* Distributed computing, is a branch of Computer Science which study the protocol systems able to exchange and compute data information between of a network of computer nodes: the set of computer nodes and the undelying protocol rules which allows the computation are the contituents of the **Distributed system**.  
  * The nodes, composing the network are able to indipendently verify and validate such set of data and they can contruct a complete or partial (depending on the protocol) snapshots of the network and it's property; we will call them the [state](#) of the system
  * Among the most important properties of a Distributed Systems we find the **chronological ordering** of the events and thus the *sequence of state changes* that take place inside the system.
  * The achievement of a *resilient and reliable* chronological ordering for distributed system, achieving important properties such as permissionlessness and censorship resistance, was reached by Satoshi Nakamoto with the invention of Bitcoin, using the blockchain data structure and a Proof-of-Work consensus which is able to entrust differrent participants to the system according to their computational power     
* We will discuss a particular **set of distributed systems** which have some degree of hierarchy and interrelated properties and which in the current context are based on based on Bitcoin but can be teorethically extended to other system. They are differentiated on how the data are organized:
  * **Blockchain /Timechain + PoW Mechanism (layer 1)**. The sequence of **state transitions** is public and auditable and is organized in **transaction** included in ordered blocks.
  * **State channel (layer 2)** which depend hierarchically on layer 1 being
  * **Client Side Validated Data (layer3?)**
