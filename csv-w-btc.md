# Client-side Validation with Bitcoin

In this section we will explore the application of client-side validation and single-use seal to Bitcoin Blockchain, introducing the main architectural features behind **RGB** protocol.
As mentioned in the [previous chapter](intro-tech.md) this cryptographic operations can be generally applied to different blockchain and even to different pubblication media. However, the outstanding properties of Bitcoin consensus algorithm in particular related to decentralization, censorship resistance and permissionlessness make it the ideal technologycal stak for developing advanced programmability features such as those required by digital bearer rights and smart contracts.

## Single-use Seals in Bitcoin Transactions and RGB

From previously, we recall that Single-use Seals creation undergo two fundamental operations: **Seal Definition** and **Seal Closing**. We will now explore how these two operations can be implemented **using Bitcoin as a pubblication medium**, and in particular making use of some elements of **Bitcoin Transactions**. 

There are 2 main ways in which a Single-use Seal can be **defined** in Bitcoin transactions:

* **Public keys or addresses** - the seal is defined selecting an address or a public key which has not been used yet (i.e. have not been used to lock some bitcoins)
* **Bitcoin transaction outputs** â€“ the seal is defined by selecting a specific UTXO available to some wallet.

This definition methods can be employed in a combination of **closing methods** which differentiate themselves according to how a **spending transaction**:
1. Uses the seal definition: use of the address in locking script / spend of the UTXO  
2. Host the message over which the seal is closed according to a **commitment scheme** (i.e. in which part of the transaction the message is committed and stored).
     
The following table illustrates the 4 possible combinations of seal definition and seal closing:

| Scheme name  | Seal Definition         | Seal Closing            | Additional Requirements                             |  Main application              | Possible commitment schemes      |
|--------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| PkO          | Public key value        | Transaction output      | P2(W)PKH                                            |  none yet                      | Keytweak, tapret, opret          |                  
| **TxO2**     | **Transaction output**  | **Transaction output**  | **Requires Deterministic Bitcoin Commitments**      |  **RGBv1 (universal)**         | **Keytweak, tapret, opret**      |                  
| PkI          | Public key value        | Transaction input       | Taproot-only - Not working with legacy wallets      |  Bitcoin-based identities      | Sigtweak, witweak                |                  
| TxOI         | Transaction output      | Transaction input       | Taproot-only - Not working with legacy wallets      |  none yet                      | Sigtweak, witweak                | 

**RGB protocol uses the TxO2** scheme in which both seal definition and the seal closing uses the Outputs (the "**O2**" in **TxO2** acronym stand for **2 Outputs** meaning that both the seal definition and the seal closing uses transaction Outputs).

As shown in the table, the possible **commitment schemes** are associated with the places of the transaction in which the messagge is committed which is further differentiate whether the message is committed in transaction input or output:
* Transaction Input:
     * Sigtweak - the commitment is placed inside the random 32-byte **r** component constituting the **<r,s>** ECDSA signature pair of an input. It make uses of [Sign-to-contract (S2C)](https://blog.eternitywall.com/2018/04/13/sign-to-contract/#sign-to-contract)
     * Witweak - the commitment is placed inside the segregated witness data of the transaction
* Transaction Output (ScriptPubKey):
     * Keytweak - It uses the [Pay-to-contract](https://blog.eternitywall.com/2018/04/13/sign-to-contract/#pay-to-contract) construction through which the outpu's public key of the output is "tweaked" (i.e. modified) in order to contain a deterministic reference to the message.   
     * **Opret** - The message committed is placed as an unspendable output after`OP_RETURN` opcode.
     * **Tapret (taptweak)** - This scheme represent a form of tweak in which the message is committed into an `OP_RETURN` tagged string placed into a leaf in the `Script path` of a [taproot transaction](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki) which thus change the value of the PubKey.

## TxO2 Client-side Validation 

In the next paragraphs we will focus on client side validation combined with single-use seal definition an closing operation of the **TxO2** scheme, showing them step by step below and using the 2 usual cryptographic characters: Alice, dealing with a seal operation, and Bob as an observer.

1. First of all Alice, have some UTXO at her disposal **which reference some client validated data known only by her**.

2. Alice communicate to Bob that the spending of some UTXO represent the signal that something has happened.

3. Once Alice spend its UTXO,  only Bob knows that this spend has an additional meaning even if everybody (i.e. the audience of Bitcoin Blockchain) can see this event.

4. Indeed, the UTXO spent by Alice through the **witness transaction** contains a commitment to the client-side validated data. By passing the original data to Bob, she is able to prove to Bob that those data are duly referenced by the commitment placed by Alice in the spending transaction. The verification operation is performed by Bob independenly, using the appropriate methods that are part of the client-side validation protocol (e.g. RGB protocol).

The key point of single-use seal usage in combination with client-side validation consists in the uniqueness of the spending event and the data committed (i.e. the message) to it, which cannot be altered in the future. The whole operation can be summed up in the following terms.

The next important step is to illustrate precisely how the two commitment schemes, **opret** and **tapret** works and which are the features they need to fullfill, in partircular related to determinism of the commitment.   

## Deterministic Bitcoin Commitment 

The main requirement for a Bitcoin commitment scheme to be valid is that:
> The witness closing transaction must provably contain a single commitment

With this requirements it is not possible to construct some "alternative story" related to the commitment of the client-side data in the same transaction. This way the message around which we close the single-use seal is unique. In order to fullfill the requirement, independently of the number of outputs in a transaction, *one and only one output* for each commitment scheme (opret and tapret) is valid:

> Uniqueness of the RGB commitment: the only valid outputs which can contain an RGB message commitment are:
> 1. The first OP_RETURN output (if present) for `opret` commitment scheme
> 2. The first taproot output (if present) for `tapret` commitment scheme

It is worth noting that a transaction can contain both a single `opret` and a single `tapret` commitment in two distinct outputs. Naturally, those commitments will commit to different client-side validated data, as we will see later, the data indicates explicitly the commitment method used to reference them in order to be validated.   

### Opret

It's the most simple and immediate scheme. The commitment is placed in the first OP_RETURN outputof the witness transaction in the following way:

`OP_RETURN` `OP_PUSHBYTE_32` `<32-byte  Tagged Multi Protocol Commitment (MPC) tree root hash>`

So the total size of the *ScriptPubKey* is 34 bytes. We will 

### Tapret

Tapret scheme represents a more complex form of deterministic commitment, and represent an improvement in terms of on-chain footprint and privacy of the contract. The main idea behind this application is to hide the commitment inside the `Script path Spend` of a [taproot transaction](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki). It is worth noting that to preserve the highest degree of flexibility the `tapret` commitment scheme can be used both by creating a new taproot transaction used only for RGB commitment purposes, or **can be inserted in an already-existent taproot transaction created for payment purposes of the receiving party outside of RGB**. This way, an even greater degree of privacy and plausible deniability is achieved. 

To this end it is usefull to make a short recap of the structure and the construction of a [taproot tweaked ScriptPubKey Q](https://lightning.engineering/posts/2023-04-19-taproot-musig2-recap/), which in this example is constituted by a Key Path Spend with internal key `P` and a 3-script tree in the Script Path Spend.

## Multi Protocol Commitment

This section will address the following important points:

1. How the tagged value which is committed according to either `opret` or `tapret` schemes is constructed?
2. How it is possible to store in a single commitment the state change of more than one contract/asset?
