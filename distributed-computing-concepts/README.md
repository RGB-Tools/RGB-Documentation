# Distributed Computing Concepts

Before divining into the technical details of the RGB, the introduction to the fundamental concepts of the technology, as well as the study of the base terminology represent the essential step towards a thorough understanding of the subject.

Indeed RGB it's a combination of several pieces of the Distributed Computing Domain, in particular:

* Commitment scheme with cryptographic hash functions.
* Client-side Validation.
* Single-use Seals.

The combination of such topics is the underlying substrate that makes RGB possible.
